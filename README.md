# React Gallery App

For this project I created a image gallery app using the React library along side the "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library. The app is built in the style of a single-page app to keep it fast and modular

JSX was used to write markup-like syntax directly in my JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components

Other React tools like Create React App was used to initialise the project and React Router was used to create routes within the app

The images used were fetched via the Axios tool from the Flickr API

There are three default topic pages that can be selected or the search bar can be used to get images of another thing
